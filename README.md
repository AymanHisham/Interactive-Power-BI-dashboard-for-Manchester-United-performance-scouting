## 📝 Project Description
This is my second major project, and as a Manchester United fan, it was a labor of love. It took significant time to gather, clean, and synthesize data from across the web—specifically using sources like **FBRef**, **WhoScored**, **Transfermarkt**, and independent match research. 

This dashboard is designed to show how the team is progressing, how individual players are performing, and what the tactical future looks like. My goal is to become a **Sports Data Analyst**, and this project demonstrates my ability to turn raw match data into a professional scouting and tactical tool.
